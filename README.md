Wind & Weather Data Logger

This project is a wind and weather data logger using a cup anemometer, SD card module, DHT sensor, key matrix, and an LCD display. It records wind velocity, temperature, and humidity data to an SD card with configurable filename and sampling interval using the key matrix.

Features

Measures wind velocity using a cup anemometer

Records temperature and humidity using a DHT sensor

Stores data on an SD card

Configurable filename and sample interval via key matrix

LCD display for real-time data and settings

Components Used

Cup Anemometer – Measures wind speed

DHT Sensor – Captures temperature and humidity data

SD Card Module – Stores recorded data

Key Matrix – Sets filename and sampling interval

LCD Display – Shows real-time readings and settings

Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino) – Manages data collection and storage

Setup & Usage

Connect Components: Wire the anemometer, DHT sensor, SD card module, key matrix, and LCD display to the microcontroller.

Upload Code: Flash the microcontroller with the provided Arduino code.

Power Up: Connect the system to a power source.

Set Filename & Interval: Use the key matrix to define the filename and sampling interval.

Start Logging: The system will begin recording wind speed, temperature, and humidity data to the SD card.

Retrieve Data: Remove the SD card and access the recorded files on a computer.

Data Format

The recorded data is stored in a CSV format:

Timestamp, Wind Speed (m/s), Temperature (°C), Humidity (%)
2025-01-29 12:00:00, 5.4, 22.3, 55
2025-01-29 12:01:00, 6.1, 22.4, 54

Dependencies

Ensure the following Arduino libraries are installed:

DHT.h (for temperature & humidity sensor)

SD.h (for SD card module)

LiquidCrystal.h (for LCD display)

Keypad.h (for key matrix input)

Future Improvements

Add data transmission via WiFi/Bluetooth

Implement graphical data visualization on LCD

Improve power efficiency for long-term deployment
